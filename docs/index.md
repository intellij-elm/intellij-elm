## In More Detail

IntelliJ is a powerful and free IDE built on a unique architecture. Rather than working with source code in its text form, IntelliJ parses the source code into an abstract syntax tree (AST). All functionality and refactorings are built on this AST, allowing for much more sophisticated features than normally possible in a text editor that relies on regex and find/replace.

Here are a few of the advanced features provided by [intellij-elm](https://github.com/klazuka/intellij-elm): 


### Add Import Quick Fix

While you write code, intellij-elm checks that the functions and types that your program uses can be resolved based on what's in scope. Errors are marked in red. If the error can be resolved by adding an import, intellij-elm will offer a quick fix action. Press Option-Enter (Alt-Enter on Windows) and then select "Import" to generate the appropriate `import` and add it to the top of your file. No more scrolling to the top and then back down again just to fiddle with imports!

### Rename Refactoring

Reliably rename types, functions, values, modules and files. Press Shift-F6 to rename the identifier under the cursor. All references will also be renamed, including `import` statements and `exposing` lists.

### Find Usages
 
Find all usages of a type, function, value or module. Press Option-F7 (Ctrl-F7 on Windows) while the cursor is on an identifier to find all of its usages.

### Quick Docs
 
Press Ctrl-J to display the documentation for a function, type, etc. It even works with doc comments within your own code.

### Structure View

Get a 30,000 ft view of your Elm file's types, functions and values.

Press Cmd-F12 (Ctrl-F12 on Windows) to popup the quick structure navigator. Use your keyboard to jump between functions and types effortlessly.

### Code Folding

By default, a module's `import`s are automatically collapsed using code folding. You can also collapse function and type declarations.

### Type-annotation-driven Development

When writing new code, it's often helpful to write the type annotations first. Once you've written a type annotation, press Option-Enter (Alt-Enter on Windows) and select "Create" from the quick fix menu. A function declaration will be generated for you based on your type annotation.
