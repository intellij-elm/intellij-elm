# Open Existing Project

Already have some Elm code that you want to edit in IntelliJ? First, make sure that you have the Elm plugin installed. When you open IntelliJ, you'll see a launch screen.

You might be tempted to click "Import Project" but there's a simpler way. Instead, click the "Open" button and select your existing project directory.

Once your project loads and you open a `.elm` file, you will be prompted to setup the toolchain (paths to things like the Elm compiler as well as elm-format and elm-test). After that's configured, you'll be prompted to attach an `elm.json` file. Use the file picker to locate the `elm.json` file for your project.
