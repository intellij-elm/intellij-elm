# Create New Project

Ready to start a new Elm project in IntelliJ? First, make sure that you have the Elm plugin installed. When you open IntelliJ, you'll see a launch screen.

1. Click 'Create New Project'
2. Select 'Elm' from the panel on the left.
3. Click the 'Next' button
4. Give your project a name and a location on disk

**WebStorm users**: Due to [a bug](https://github.com/klazuka/intellij-elm/issues/414), the above steps will not work. Instead, you can create a new project by first creating a directory, run `elm init`, and then open that directory in WebStorm.
