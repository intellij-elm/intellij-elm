# WebGL / GLSL

Syntax highlighting and code completion for WebGL/GLSL literals in your Elm code.

Useful for anyone creating graphics or games using WebGL in Elm.

Performance impact is difficult to quantify as it depends on a separate plugin. However, it should be proportional to the number of GLSL literals in your Elm file.

## Enable

1. Go to **IntelliJ Settings**
2. Select **Plugins**
3. Search for [GLSL](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6993-glsl-support) and install it

Once it's enabled and you've restarted IntelliJ, GLSL literals in your Elm program will have syntax highlighting and code completion.


## Demo

Here's what it looks like when enabled:
