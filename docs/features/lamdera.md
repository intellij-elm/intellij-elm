# Lamdera project support

This plugin supports Lamdera projects.
A Lamdera project currently consists of:
- `elm.json` with a direct dependency to packages "lamdera/codecs" and "lamdera/core"
- `Frontend.elm` with a top-level definition named `app` defined by [frontend](https://dashboard.lamdera.app/docs/api) 
- `Backend.elm` with a top-level definition named `app` defined by [backend](https://dashboard.lamdera.app/docs/api)

To get going, you can download Lamdera's compiler here:
