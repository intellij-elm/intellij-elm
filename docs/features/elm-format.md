# elm-format

Run [elm-format](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format) via a keyboard shortcut or automatically whenever you save a file.

This is useful for Elm projects with many team members. You can save
time in code review if your files are just always formatted this way.

If format-on-save is enabled, this feature may lead to slight delays (<500ms) when saving.

## Enable

1. Open **IntelliJ Settings**.
2. Select **Languages & Frameworks** from the left-side pane
3. Select **Elm**
4. Fill out the section titled **elm-format** (use the **Auto Discover** button to search common locations)
