# Installation

You can install the plugin from within the JetBrains IDE by going to `Settings -> Plugins` and then searching for "Elm". Then click the `Search in repositories` link.

If, however, you need to install a specific version of the plugin, you can get it from [the releases page](https://github.com/klazuka/intellij-elm/releases).


# Attaching Elm JSON files

One major change since earlier versions of this plugin is that you must now attach your Elm project's JSON manifest
file (either `elm.json` for Elm 0.19 or `elm-package.json` for 0.18). The plugin will try to find this JSON file 
on its own, but you may need to manually attach it if the magic fails.


# Integrating with elm-format

See the elm-format [integration instructions](https://github.com/klazuka/intellij-elm/blob/master/docs/elm-format/setup.md).


# Attribution

This project heavily leverages the open-source work of other IntelliJ plugin developers:

* Code organization and testing utils based on the [Rust plugin](https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust) for IntelliJ. 
* Lexer and Parser originally from Kamil Durkiewicz's [elm-intellij-plugin](https://github.com/durkiewicz/elm-plugin).
* Offside-rule Lexer originally based on code from Alexander Kiel's [idea-haskell](https://github.com/alexanderkiel/idea-haskell) plugin.

Thank you Kamil, Alexander, and the Rust plugin developers.


# Donation

If this plugin improves your Elm development experience, and you want to give back, please consider making a [donation](http://www.brahmrishiyoga.org/donate) (tax-deductible in the US) to the [Narmada Vidya Peeth school](http://www.brahmrishiyoga.org/jabalpur_school/photo_gallery) in Jabalpur, India. This school provides a completely free education to 550 boys and girls, from ages 5 to 17. I have visited the school three times since 2012, and I can vouch for the worthiness of the cause.

Alternatively consider making donations to your favorite open-source developers and projects.
