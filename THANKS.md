# Attribution

This project heavily leverages the open-source work of other IntelliJ plugin developers:

* Code organization and testing utils based on the [Rust plugin](https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust) for IntelliJ. 
* Lexer and Parser originally from Kamil Durkiewicz's [elm-intellij-plugin](https://github.com/durkiewicz/elm-plugin).
* Offside-rule Lexer originally based on code from Alexander Kiel's [idea-haskell](https://github.com/alexanderkiel/idea-haskell) plugin.

Thank you Kamil, Alexander, and the Rust plugin developers.


# Donation

If this plugin improves your Elm development experience, and you want to give back, please consider making a [donation](http://www.brahmrishiyoga.org/donate) (tax-deductible in the US) to the [Narmada Vidya Peeth school](http://www.brahmrishiyoga.org/jabalpur_school/photo_gallery) in Jabalpur, India. This school provides a completely free education to 550 boys and girls, from ages 5 to 17. I have visited the school three times since 2012, and I can vouch for the worthiness of the cause.
