/**
 * A base class for implementing intentions: actions available via "light bulb" / `Alt+Enter`.
 *
 * The cool thing about intentions is their UX: there is a huge number of intentions,
 * and they all can be invoked with a single `Alt + Enter` shortcut. This is possible
 * because at the position of the cursor only small number of intentions is applicable.
 *
 * So, intentions consists of two functions: [findApplicableContext] functions determines
 * if the intention can be applied at the given position, it is used to populate "light bulb" list.
 * [invoke] is called when the user selects the intention from the list and must apply the changes.
 *
 * The context collected by [findApplicableContext] is gathered into [Ctx] object and is passed to
 * [invoke]. In general, [invoke] should never fail: if you need to check if some element is not
 * null, do this in [findApplicableContext] and pass the element via the context.
 *
 * [findApplicableContext] is executed under a read action, and [invoke] under a write action.
